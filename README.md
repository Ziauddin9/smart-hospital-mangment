# Overview

MediCore HMS is a comprehensive Hospital Management System developed to simplify day-to-day hospital operations through an intuitive and responsive web application.

The system provides dedicated modules for managing patients, doctors, departments, appointments, electronic medical records, laboratory services, pharmacy inventory, and billing. By centralizing these operations, it helps improve data organization, reduce manual work, and enhance overall workflow efficiency.

The frontend is developed using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, while **Supabase** provides backend services including authentication, PostgreSQL database management, and REST APIs. The application is deployed using **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.

# Supabase Backend

MediCore HMS uses **Supabase** as its Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), providing a secure and scalable backend without the need to manage a traditional server.

Supabase powers the application's authentication, database, and API layer, allowing the frontend to communicate directly with the backend through the official Supabase JavaScript client.

## Services Used

- PostgreSQL Database
- Supabase Authentication
- REST API
- Supabase JavaScript Client
- Row Level Security (RLS)

---

## Authentication

The application uses **Supabase Authentication** to securely manage user access.

### Supported Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Secure Session Management
- Email and Password Authentication
- Protected Application Access

Authenticated users can securely access the application after successful login.

---

## Database

Hospital data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

### Database Tables

| Table | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| departments | Hospital department information |
| doctors | Doctor profiles and details |
| patients | Patient records |
| appointments | Appointment scheduling |
| medical_records | Patient medical history |
| medicines | Pharmacy inventory |
| prescriptions | Prescription information |
| lab_tests | Laboratory test requests |
| lab_reports | Laboratory test reports |
| invoices | Billing information |
| payments | Payment records |

---

## Frontend Integration

The application communicates with Supabase using the official **@supabase/supabase-js** client.

The client configuration is located in:

```text
src/lib/supabase.ts
```

The frontend performs operations such as:

- User Authentication
- Fetching Records
- Creating New Records
- Updating Existing Records
- Deleting Records

All communication between the frontend and database is handled securely through the Supabase API.

# Application Architecture

```text
React + TypeScript
        │
        ▼
Supabase JavaScript Client
        │
        ▼
Supabase REST API
        │
        ▼
PostgreSQL Database
```

This architecture provides a simple, scalable, and secure backend while allowing the frontend application to interact directly with Supabase services.

---

# Deployment

This project is deployed using **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Amazon S3 Bucket
- AWS Management Console

---

## Step 1: Build the Project

Generate the production build.

```bash
npm run build
```

The production files will be created inside the `dist` directory.

---

## Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the **Amazon S3** service.
3. Click **Create bucket**.
4. Enter a globally unique bucket name.
5. Select your preferred AWS Region.
6. Create the bucket.

---

## Step 3: Enable Static Website Hosting

Open the bucket and navigate to:

```
Properties
    ↓
Static Website Hosting
```

Configure:

```
Hosting Type: Host a static website

Index document:
index.html

Error document:
index.html
```

Save the configuration.

---

## Step 4: Configure Public Access

Navigate to:

```
Permissions
    ↓
Block Public Access
```

Disable Block Public Access for the bucket.

Then add a Bucket Policy allowing public read access to the objects.

---

## Step 5: Upload the Build

Open the bucket and upload **all files inside** the `dist` folder.

> Upload the contents of the folder, **not** the `dist` folder itself.

---

## Step 6: Access the Application

After the upload completes, open the **Static Website Endpoint** provided in the bucket properties.

Your application is now deployed.
